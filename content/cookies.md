Our Privacy Policy explains how we use your information and how we store it. The Cookie Policy specifically explains how we deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a ‘session cookie’) or for multiple repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (‘third party cookies’).

## Cookies we use

We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons while some enable a personalized experience. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action, like subscribing to a newsletter or reading a post.

Below the different categories of cookies set by the Tiny News Platform are outlined, with specific examples detailed.
